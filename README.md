1. Project title: IronLibrary (Unit 3) <br />
This project aims to create a Library Management System that can help you with managing and acquiring data about the books that are available in your library and those being used by students.


2. Project Description <br />
This application allows you to navigate through a menu, concerning the four classes of the project, that include the library’s books, its students, its authors and its issues.

	The user will be asked to input a number based on the list of options displayed (how the application works is explained in the following section): <br />

	1-Add a book <br />
	2-Search book by title <br />
	3-Search book by category <br />
	4-Search book by Author <br />
	5-List all books along with author <br />
	6-Issue book to student <br />
	7-List books by usn <br />
	8-Exit <br />

	Note: after a certain action is executed, the menu is re-displayed automatically.


3. How to use the application <br />
	- You will have the possibility to add a book, by entering its ISBN, title, category, its author’s name, email and the quantity of this specific book that is available 	in your library.

	-	You will also have the possibility to search a book by its title. This command will return the book’s ISBN, its title, its category and the quantity of books available.

	-	You will have the possibility to search a book by category, returning all the books included in the category you are interested in.

	-	You will have the possibility to search a book by author, returning all of the books written by the author you are interested in.

	-	If you are not sure what you are looking for, you will also have the possibility to list all books and authors available in the library.

	-	As a real library management system, you will have the possibility to assign (issue) a certain book to a certain student. You will also be informed of the date in which the book is issued as well as when the book is due (7 days after the issue date).

	-	You will also have the possibility to list books by Universal Student Name (USN). This will allow you to check all books that are issued to a certain student.

	-	Finally, you will have the possibility to exit the application.
	
	-       Please note that, for running unit tests, it is necessary to comment line 225 in class IronLibraryApplication.
